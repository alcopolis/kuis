The artificial denticles also allowed the paddle to travel the same simulated distance while using 5.9% less energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s a huge effect, when factored over the entire lifetime of an animal that is constantly swimming,&quot; said Prof Lauder.</p>\r\n', '0', '7', 'pending', '27c296db0469fb0da4fd5b421c6cf911.jpg', '2', '', '', null, null, null);

Garcia spends her days mixing and heating chemicals in pursuit of stronger and more easily recyclable plastics. Recently she followed a simple formula that required mixing three components in a beaker. Somehow she missed a step, leaving out a chemical. She returned to find her beaker filled with a hard white plastic that had even frozen the stirrer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Garcia tried grinding the mystery material, to no avail. Then she took a hammer to the beaker to free it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That laboratory error has led to the discovery of a new family of materials that are unusually strong and light, exhibit &ldquo;self-healing&rdquo; properties and can be easily reformed to make products recyclable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The materials &mdash; two new types of synthetic polymers &mdash; could have transportation uses. Because of their recyclability, they also could have an impact on consumer products, as well as on the industrial packaging for microelectronics components.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The findings were reported on Thursday in the journal Science by a research team at IBM&rsquo;s Almaden Research Laboratory in San Jose, Calif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been an explosion of new polymer materials in recent years, but most of them are variants of existing synthetic classes that are characterized by long chains of simpler molecules connected through chemical bonds. The materials are today ubiquitous in modern life, found in everything from paints and contact lenses to garments and batteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are just pervasively used materials,&rdquo; said James L. Hedrick, an advanced organic materials scientist at IBM in San Jose. &ldquo;This is the polymer age.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IBM scientists say that this is the first distinctly new family that has been discovered in several decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They said they had not yet named the new family, which they have code-named &ldquo;Titan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hydro.&rdquo; The materials are not yet ready for commercial use, but the scientists said they had already begun working with several universities on composite applications that could have a significant impact on manufacturing and fabrication in the fields of transportation, aerospace and microelectronics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The materials are known as thermosets because they are formed using a heating process. Their strength comes from their three-dimensional network of chemical bonds. The polymers have the rigidity of bones, one of the strongest biological materials, and can be made as much as 50 percent stronger by blending them in composite form with materials like carbon nanotubes. They also tend to perform better than other types of polymers under high temperatures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IBM has invested heavily in new computational chemistry technologies that rely on supercomputers.

Over time, the traffic gets more congested and more people are on the road, therefore the speed of the traffic slows down. &#39;Throttling&#39;&nbsp;would be removing a lane. &#39;Adding capacity&#39; is building another lane to allow traffic to move at a better, faster rate.

Ia kaget ketika kemudian menerima telepon dari Jeremy King&nbsp;yang menyatakan akan segera menarik draft undang-undang itu. King adalah seorang senator yang mengusulkan RUU tersebut. Di Indonesia juga sudah ada contohnya. Teman-teman pasti masih ingat. Twiter juga punya peran yang sama. Presiden Barack Obama terbantu oleh jejaring sosial ketika maju menjadi calon presiden untuk periode pertama.

Beberapa cara yang akan saya sebutkan ini semoga bisa sedikit membuka mata kita tentang mindset yang benar bagaimana mencari uang dari internet. Karena selama ini kita sudah sering melihat iklan-iklan yang bisa dikatakan kurang bertanggungjawab yang menyesatkan. Seperti cara cepat dapat uang dengan mudah sampai ratusan bahkan jutaan dalam satu hati hanya dengan menerapkan ilmu yang untuk melaksanakannya dibutuhkan kurang dari sejam aja per-harinya. Dan beberapa iklan jualan pdf yang terlalu bombastis yang lain. Bagaimana&nbsp; cara-cara mendapatkan uang di internet yang realistis tersebut? Berikut sebagiannya :</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Pertama, adalah dengan iklan. Cara ini sukses diterapkan oleh facebook. Sang Pemilik Mark-Z hanya fokus pada ambisi besarnya untuk menghubungkan banyak orang di dunia ini dengan jaringan global. Maka dia ciptakanlah facebook. Dia gratiskan aplikasi ini sehingga semua orang dapat dengan bebas menggunakannya. Sebagai gantinya untuk operasional perusahaan dia pasang iklan di aplikasinya ini. Tak disangka dari startup yang mengawali operasinya dari garasi rumah kini sudah menjadi perusahaan raksasa yang memiliki member sampai dengan 1,3 milyar orang hanya dalam waktu 10 tahun. Sangat fenomenal. Dengan pendapatan 413 juta dolar hanya dalam satu kuartal (akhir 2013 kemarin). Luar biasa bukan. Dan pemasukan dari iklan ini telah dilakukan pula oleh youtube, dan lain-lain. Bahkan situs iklan terbesar di Indonesia tokobagus.com salah satu lini pendapatannya juga dari iklan (premium), selain jualan poin.</li>\r\n	<li>Kedua, berjualan. Jika anda memiliki produk yang bagus maka anda bisa jual dengan internet. Internet anda jadikan sarana media marketing anda. Anda buat website toko online yang memajang produk-produk anda. Cara ini telah diawali oleh amazon sehingga menjadi sebuah situs penjualan terbesar di dunia hanya berangkat dari jualan buku sebelumnya. Yang menjadikan pemiliknya menjadi salah seorang terkaya di dunia. Jeff Bezos. Di Indonesia saat ini marak sekali orang berjuallan di internet dengan membuka situs jualannya. Namun saking banyaknya sampai-sampai banyak penipu yang mendompleng disana. Uang sudah dikirim tapi barang tidak dikirim. Jadi untuk mendapatkan uang dari internet dengan berjualan, anda harus menumbuhkan reputasi bagus sebagai toko terpercaya. Dan ini yang tidak mudah terutama di awal-awal ketika belum ada klien. Namun jika sudah besar, maka segala sesuatunya menjadi lebih mudah.</li>\r\n	<li>Ketiga, berjualan software.Inipun juga banyak. Sebagai turunan dari poin kedua diatas, banyak perusahaan-perusahaan besar juga mendapatkan uang dengan cara yang sama. Biasanya mereka gratiskan dulu software-nya dalam waktu beberapa puluh hari (masa trial) setelah konsumen mulai kecanduan maka masa trialnya habis dan perlu membayar untuk aktivasi produknya tersebut. Namun yang menjadi musuh utama bisnis macam ini adalah pembajakan. Kini banyak sekali cracker yang bisa mendebug serial number aplikasi. Sehingga anda harus berpikir keras untuk securitynya. Perusahaan-perusahaan penjual software besar macam microsoft juga jualan dengan cara ini. Juga adobe, dan yang lainnya. Sementara di tingkat nasional juga banyak yang telah membuat pemiliknya menikmati banyak uang dari cara ini.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', '0', '18', 'pending', '7a7ea77dc04829835d8a74cefea19b9d.jpg', '2', '', '', null, null, null);

(4) Menampilkan percobaan pembunuhan. (5) Adegan percobaan bunuh diri. (6) Menampilkan remaja yang menggunakan <em>testpack</em> karena hamil di luar nikah. (7) Adanya dialog yang menganjurkan untuk menggugurkan kandungan. (8) Adegan seolah memakan kelinci hidup. (9) Menampilkan seragam sekolah yang tidak sesuai dengan etika pendidikan. (10) Adegan menampilkan kehidupan bebas yang dilakukan anak remaja, seperti merokok, minum-minuman keras dan kehidupan dunia malam. (11) Adegan percobaan pemerkosaan. (12) Konflik rumah tangga dan perselingkuhan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mengingat KPI adalah lembaga negara independen &ndash; pembentukannya berdasarkan amanat UU Penyiaran No. 32 Tahun 2002, keputusan bahwa ada sinetron atau tontonan televise tertentu yang melanggar kaidah moral sebetulnya dapat dimengerti sebagai bagian dari tugas dan tanggung jawab mereka.

If you\'re a regular reader of blogs, you probably come across great articles that you just want everyone to know about. But what\'', '2014-05-16 17:32:49', '<p>One of the best things about the web and social media is how much great information is written and produced every single day. If you&#39;re a regular reader of blogs, you probably come across great articles that you just want everyone to know about. But what&#39;s the best way to share these posts?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, there&#39;s no shortage of ways to spread the word. Blogs, social networks, instant messenger, and mobile phones are some of the many ways to let others know about the best content on the web. Here are our 20 favorite ways to share a great blog post:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Using Twitter to Tweet and Share:</strong> Perhaps the fastest and most effective way to share a great blog post is through <a href=\"http://twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>. Sharing or retweeting a link in Twitter can spread like wildfire. Use a URL shortener such as <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com\" target=\"_blank\">tinyurl</a> or <a href=\"http://bit.ly\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly</a> to shorten links to fit within 140 characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Posting to Facebook:</strong> Sharing a blog post on the world&#39;s largest social network is as simple as going to the <a href=\"http://facebook.com\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> homepage and posting a link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Digg it:</strong> Not only will you help bring that blog post one step closer to reaching the front page of the news site <a href=\"http://digg.com\" target=\"_blank\">Digg</a> (which will spread it even further), but all of your Digg friends will see it as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Post on MySpace Profile:</strong> Don&#39;t forget about the world&#39;s second largest social network when sharing your favorite articles. Post the link to your <a href=\"http://myspace.com\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a> profile so your friends can enjoy it too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Posting to LinkedIn:</strong> Some blog posts are worthy of being shared by your business network on <a href=\"http://linkedin.com\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a>. Post a link to the Network Updates area in the homepage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Stumbling on StumbleUpon</strong> Stumble the post! <a href=\"http://stumbleupon.com\" target=\"_blank\">StumbleUpon</a> is a favorite network for discovering fun websites and useful information, so make sure that you give the post a thumbs up. The <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/138\" target=\"_blank\">StumbleUpon Toolbar</a> is the easiest way to Stumble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Bookmarking to Delicious:</strong> <a href=\"http://delicious.com\" target=\"_blank\">Delicious</a> is great for not only sharing posts, but for helping categorize blog posts for others to find. In addition, you can import your delicious bookmarks to <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/facebook/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"http://mashable.com/category/friendfeed/\">FriendFeed</a>, and other social media websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Sharing on FriendFeed:</strong> The social media aggregator <a href=\"http://friendfeed.com\" target=\"_blank\">FriendFeed</a> has a vibrant community who love to share videos, links, and pictures. Use the <a href=\"http://friendfeed.com/share/bookmarklet\" target=\"_blank\">FriendFeed bookmarklet</a> to quickly share a good blog post to FriendFeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Adding to Reddit:</strong> <a href=\"http://reddit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a> is another great social media site for sharing and voting on articles. It&#39;s quick and easy to <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/submit\" target=\"_blank\">submit a link</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sharing Via Blogs:</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Reblogging Great Posts:</strong> Blogging about a great article is one of the best ways to engage with the topics being discussed. Post a link, write some commentary, and share it with all of your readers. And don&#39;t forget to share your own blog post as well!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. Sharing via Google Reader:</strong> <a href=\"http://reader.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google Reader</a> has a great feature for sharing blog posts. If you use Google Reader as your news reader of choice, all you have to do is click the &quot;share&quot; button at the bottom of blog posts to share it with all of your Google friends. You can also add notes and comment as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. Posting on Tumblr or Posterous:</strong> If you want to share something via a blog, but don&#39;t want to write a full blog post about it, there are great options for that as well, primarily <a href=\"http://tumblr.com\" target=\"_blank\">Tumblr</a> and <a href=\"http://posterous.com\" target=\"_blank\">Posterous</a>. They are the quick and easy versions of full-fledged blogs, ideal for posting about pictures and blog posts.</p>\r\n', '0', '2', 'pending', '70bba93c719364cac71660f238f9b087.jpg', '2', 'First Media', '2 Mbps', null, null, null);
