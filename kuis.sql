In this way, the denticles act like the dimples on a golf ball. Now, researchers have also seen them alter specific currents that help propel the shark through water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>George Lauder and his colleagues took a detailed scan of a tiny square of skin from a mako shark, and built a 3D model of a single denticle just 0.15mm long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge was then to manufacture a synthetic skin, with thousands of these denticles embedded in a smooth, flexible membrane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;It took us about a year,&quot; said Prof Lauder, of Harvard University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3D printing builds up new objects layer-by-layer, following a computer-generated design. To print the shark skin, the scientists had to use two different materials for the hard, tooth-like structures and for the flexible base - much like the different coloured inks used to print a picture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The particular shape of the denticles also posed difficulties: &quot;Because they&#39;re overhung, the 3D printers have to print a supporting material, which you then have to remove,&quot; Prof Lauder told the BBC. &quot;It took a while to work out all the tricks.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artificial skin has impressed Oliver Crimmen, a fish expert at the Natural History Museum who has previously advised Speedo on swim suit design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I used to think, how on earth would you mimic that complex structure accurately?&quot; he said. &quot;3D printing is it - what a marvellous application for it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the resolution of even the latest 3D printers is limited, the artificial denticles are about 10 times larger than the real ones seen on the skin of a mako shark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, when the team stuck the new artificial skin onto a small, flexible paddle and studied it in a water tank, they were able to see the benefit sharks glean from their unusual scales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A paddle with the new, toothy skin delivered a boost of up to 6.6% in swimming speed, compared to one coated with the smooth membrane alone. The artificial denticles also allowed the paddle to travel the same simulated distance while using 5.9% less energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;That&#39;s a huge effect, when factored over the entire lifetime of an animal that is constantly swimming,&quot; said Prof Lauder.</p>\r\n', 0, 4, 'pending', '27c296db0469fb0da4fd5b421c6cf911.jpg', 2, NULL, NULL, NULL),
